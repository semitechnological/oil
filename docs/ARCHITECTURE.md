# Architecture

## Overview

Wax is a fast, modern package manager built in Rust that leverages Homebrew's ecosystem without the overhead. This document describes the technical architecture, design decisions, and implementation patterns.

## System Design

### Core Philosophy

Wax replaces Homebrew's git-based tap system with direct JSON API access and parallel async operations. It reads from the same bottle CDN and formula definitions but executes operations through a compiled binary with modern concurrency primitives.

### Key Design Decisions

**JSON API over Git**: Fetches all ~15,600 formulae/casks via single HTTP request rather than cloning entire tap repository. Enables instant search without filesystem traversal.

**Bottles First, Source When Needed**: Prioritizes precompiled bottles for maximum speed. Automatically falls back to source compilation when bottles are unavailable. Detects build system (Autotools, CMake, Meson, Make) and executes appropriate build workflow.

**Custom Tap Support**: Extends beyond core taps by cloning third-party taps as Git repositories. Parses Ruby formula files to extract metadata and build instructions. Integrates tap formulae with core formulae for unified package discovery.

**Async-First**: Uses tokio runtime for all I/O operations. Parallel downloads with configurable concurrency limits (default 8 simultaneous).

**Homebrew Coexistence**: Installs to the same Cellar structure and reads existing Homebrew-installed packages. It also performs best-effort discovery of manually installed macOS apps and Linux dpkg/rpm packages so the installed-package view reflects software added outside Wax.

## Performance Optimizations

### Fast Queries

- In-memory index after first load
- No git operations
- No Ruby interpreter startup
- Native string matching
- Compiled binary execution

### Fast Updates

- Single JSON API request
- Concurrent formulae/cask fetching
- Streaming JSON parsing
- Efficient cache serialization

### Fast Installs

- Parallel bottle downloads
- Concurrent checksum verification
- Streaming extraction
- Minimal filesystem operations
- Post-install scripts are opt-out with `--no-script`

### Source Building

- CPU core detection for parallel compilation
- ccache integration when available
- Build system auto-detection
- Incremental build support (Ninja for CMake/Meson)
- Isolated build directories (tempdir)

## Security

### Checksum Verification

- SHA256 validation for all bottles
- Checksums from official Homebrew API
- Download rejection on mismatch
- Prevents corrupted/tampered packages

### GHCR Authentication

- Anonymous token request
- Scoped repository access
- Token per download session
- No stored credentials

### Safe Symlinks

- Validate target existence
- Check for conflicts before creation
- Safe removal (only remove owned symlinks)
- No overwrites without confirmation

## Limitations

### Current Limitations

1. Build system detection is heuristic-based and may fail for complex configurations
2. Binary relocation support is best-effort and may not cover every bottle layout
3. Native post-install execution without Homebrew compatibility tooling is limited
4. No caveats display
5. Ruby formula parser supports common patterns but not advanced DSL features
6. No patch application during source builds

### Design Trade-offs

**Speed vs Compatibility**: Chose speed by skipping source builds and complex formula logic. Covers 95%+ of use cases.

**Simplicity vs Features**: Minimal state tracking and no service management. Users can fall back to brew for edge cases.

**Safety vs Performance**: Always verify checksums and validate symlinks, even at cost of extra I/O.

## Extension Points

### Future Enhancements

1. Broader binary relocation support (install_name_tool on macOS)
2. Native post-install script execution (sandboxed)
3. Patch application during source builds
4. Advanced Ruby DSL parsing (conditions, variables)
5. HTTP caching (ETag, If-Modified-Since)
6. Partial index updates (delta fetching)
7. Distributed caching (CDN for index)
8. Build caching and reuse across installations
9. Tap formula caching (avoid re-parsing Ruby files)

## Development Guidelines

### Code Organization

- One module per concern
- Public API in module root
- Internal helpers as private functions
- Commands isolated in commands/ directory

### Error Handling

- Use Result<T> for all fallible operations
- Add context with specific error variants
- Provide user-actionable error messages
- Log errors with tracing for debugging

### Testing Strategy

- Integration tests for CLI commands
- Unit tests for core algorithms (deps, platform detection)
- Mock HTTP responses for API tests
- Cross-platform testing (macOS, Linux)

### Performance Considerations

- Async for all I/O operations
- Batch operations where possible
- Stream large downloads
- Minimize allocations
- Profile before optimizing
